This module provides a unique hotbar for every token. If the token is linked to an actor (for player characters), then all tokens of that actor will have the same hotbar.

It's slimmed down to make maintenance easier and hopefully the code is easier to understand for
anyone who has ever written a macro in Foundry.

## Features

### Dynamically change the hotbar
All pages of the hotbar will change depending on the token you have selected.

### Use an additional hotbar
Unfortunately, this version of Token Hotbar does not work with Norc's Custom Hotbar.

### Shared Token Hotbar
Hotbar's can be shared manually via the provided macro. A GM can run this macro and select for which
tokens and with which player they want to share the hotbar. You can find this macro in the compendium 'Token Hotbar'.

### Settings
* **Always link to actor:** link the hotbar to the actor, even if the token itself is not linked.
* **Debug Mode:** Show detailed messages in the console (F12).
